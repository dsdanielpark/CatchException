> Nightly version of [Except Notifier](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/ExceptNotifier) for refactoring

In preparation for the beta release, the package architecture is overhauled. Test by refactoring with some extensibility open. <br>
Applies to [ExceptNotifier](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/ExceptNotifier) after QA.


# Note 
The refactoring process was delayed for the following reasons:

Firstly, a single developer [(@dsdanielpark)](https://github.com/dsdanielpark) completed the functional implementation, documentation, and example writing for most applications in just 7 days.

In addition, I released all related packages [BardAPI](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API), [Co-Coder](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Co-Coder), and prompt engineering GitHub resources [Amazing-Bard-prompts](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/amazing-bard-prompts) for implementing Google Bard into ExceptNotifier within 3 days.

However, due to commitments to other live projects and competitions, I have limited time available.

As time permits, I plan to proceed with the refactoring process, conduct quality assurance for each application, and distribute the package.

Once the package structure is finalized, my intention is to recruit contributors for each application.

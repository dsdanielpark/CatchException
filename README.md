> Nightly version of [Except Notifier](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/ExceptNotifier) for refactoring

In preparation for the beta release, the package architecture is overhauled. Test by refactoring with some extensibility open. <br>
Applies to [ExceptNotifier](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/ExceptNotifier) after QA.

## Notice
This repository serves the purpose of discussing various structures and testing new features without officially distributing the package or compromising the integrity of the ExceptNotifier repository. And if desired, feel free to increment the version and distribute it. However, after updating the version, please provide a description of the changes in the following RELEASE_NOTE. Thank you.

Pull Requests that may not functionally work are also accepted, as the main focus is on ideas and potential improvements.

Therefore, any contributions are welcome in this repository.

Furthermore, before refactoring ExceptNotifier, please ensure that you explore the package structure, and make substantial contributions to at least one aspect.

Contributors to ExceptNotifier and CatchException may be different. ExceptNotifier is the main project, while this repository serves as a playground for experimentation and accommodating diverse opinions.

To get back to the main point, our goal is to achieve an efficient and clean distribution of ExceptNotifier.

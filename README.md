> Nightly version of Except Notifier

In preparation for the beta release, the package architecture is overhauled. Test by refactoring with some extensibility open. Applies to ExceptNotifier after QA.


# Install
```
pip insall catchexception
```

# Remark
Refactoring was not performed for the following reasons:
- The functional implementation, documentation, and example writing for most applications were completed by a single developer([@dsdanielparr](https://github.com/dsdanielpark)) in just 7 days. 
- I also released all APIs([BardAPI](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API)), sub-packages([Co-Coder](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Co-Coder)), and prompt engineering GitHub resources([Amazing-Bard-prompts](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/amazing-bard-prompts)) for implementing Google Bard into [ExceptNotifier](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/ExceptNotifier)  within 3 days. 
- Due to commitments to other live services and competitions, I have  limited time. 
- As time allows, I plan to refactor, conduct QA for each application, and distribute the package. 
- Once the package structure is finalized, I intend to recruit contributors for each application.

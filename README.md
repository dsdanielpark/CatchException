> Nightly version of Except Notifier

With Python's try-except statement, experience a significantly more flexible way to receive notifications. You can receive alerts through various messaging platforms such as email, Slack, and Discord. This package offers an extensive range of notification options to suit your needs.

Python package [`CatchException`](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/CatchException) can give a single line alarm with an error message, whereas [`knockknock`](https://github.com/huggingface/knockknock) gives a process ending alarm with decorator and cli.
